13.7.2014
- removed bug when calculating chi2
- removed phase correction on specter controls by setting visibility to false in the fft dialog
- temporarly removed Kanizotropy+Lorentzian simulation functions
- quadrupole simulation working also on 32bit systems?
- equation for Kanizotropy corrected at the Kasy term. Now the definition is the same as in La2C3 paper.

7.7.2014
- Removed bug with Pointers
- Removed bug with mFID
- removed option show modified FID
- removed option with Error in the moment analysis
- removed old simulation functions
- under simulations static variables are by default fixed

5.5.2014
- When set range correct also spcOld, or save fOld
- added additional FFT options
- LB is working correctly with DE option
- added mFID

9.1.2014: 
- Show NSC instead of NS. Since NSC is actual number of scans and not only the setted one.
